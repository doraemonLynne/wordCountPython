Note that we might be testing many different programs, e.g., wc, wc-lite.py, and any other variants. Thus, we parameterise the tester by the program we want to profile.

Of course, this pseudocode presumes we will never want to see user vs. sys CPU time. It also presumes that all comparisons between programs is done outside our tool.

Finally, we only run time **once* per input, which makes it a bit vulnerable to background fluctuations. > ## Statistical Robustness {.callout} > > When playing with time at the command line, you should have noticed that timing > the exact same program on the exact same input twice in the row typically > exhibits a fairly wide variance in time reported.
